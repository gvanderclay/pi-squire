## [Unreleased]

Not yet published to npm; install it from GitHub. Before this repository the
package lived in its author's dotfiles; the changes below are against that
copy.

### Added

- MIT license and package metadata, including `engines` (Node 22.19 or later).
- CI on Node 22.19 and 24: lint, typecheck, tests, and a check of the
  published file list.

### Fixed

- The published file list includes `child.ts`, which `index.ts` imports.
